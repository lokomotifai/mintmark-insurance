# Changelog

All notable changes to this pack are documented here. The format follows
[keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this pack uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

What is under semantic versioning here: the record types and their fields, the
recipe names and shapes, the label coverage a recipe promises, and the byte-level
output for a fixed seed. A change that alters emitted bytes for a fixed seed is a
major version event even when no field moved, because it breaks the
reproducibility of every published manifest.

The pack version is part of the pack digest and the digest seeds the streams, so
raising the version is itself such a change. Version and content correspond
exactly, which is the point.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Dataset terms travel with the data. `pack.yaml` declares `dataset_license` and
  the engine writes it into every manifest along with a credit line, so a
  downloaded dataset says under what terms it may be used instead of leaving that
  to a README nobody downloads.
- Turkish mirrors of every community document: contributing, conduct,
  governance, security, and support. A README mirror alone left a Turkish
  contributor reading the project's own rules in a second language.
- `docs/kvkk.md` and its Turkish mirror: what this pack produces and what it does
  not claim under law 6698, including a table mapping the special-category
  labels to the categories the law enumerates and naming the three it does not
  cover.
- `CITATION.cff`, issue and pull request templates, `CODEOWNERS`, and grouped
  monthly dependency updates.

### Changed

- The dataset license moved from CC0-1.0 to CC-BY-4.0. CC0 would have let a
  published dataset be resold with the provenance removed and no credit given
  anywhere. Attribution keeps the enterprise path open, because the intended
  reader of this pack is a commercial one, while making the source impossible to
  strip silently.
- Birth dates are drawn from an age window rather than from the recipe window.
  Every policyholder in a dataset describing 2026 was also born in 2026, and no
  test could have caught it: the field is a valid date, the label is right, the
  span aligns, the manifest verifies. It is only wrong to a reader.

### Notes

Nothing has been released. The reference datasets are declared in
`docs/reference-datasets.json` with their settled seeds; publishing them sits
behind the owner's approval.

### About this version number

This is the first published release and it is not 0.1.0. The pack version is part
of the pack digest and the digest seeds the streams, so every declaration change
during development moved the version with it. Versions 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 existed in
this repository and were never published; nothing reproduces from them.
