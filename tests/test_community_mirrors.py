"""Every English community document has a Turkish mirror that stays in step.

The audience for this project reads Turkish. A README mirror alone leaves a
contributor reading the contribution rules, the conduct rules, and the security
policy in a second language, which is the opposite of what the mirror was for.

These tests treat a mirror as a document, not a courtesy: it exists, it matches
the original's structure, it is not a summary, and each side points at the other.
