## What makes a useful report

A mint is a pure function of its declared inputs, so almost any defect here is
reproducible exactly. Include:

1. The exact command, with the recipe, seed, identifier policy, and format.
2. The pack version and the core version, both of which are in the manifest.
3. `MINTMARK.json` from the run, or the parts of it you can share.
4. What you observed and what you expected instead.

A report carrying a seed and a manifest can usually be reproduced on the first
attempt. A report without them usually cannot be reproduced at all.

## Support boundary

Maintained by one person alongside other work. Stated plainly rather than
implied:

- There is no service level and no response time commitment for support. Security
  reports have targets, in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- There is no commercial support offering attached to this repository.
- Help with your own pipeline, your own detector, or your own compliance position
  is out of scope. This repository produces data; what you conclude from it is
  yours to determine.
- Questions about whether using synthetic data satisfies a legal obligation
  cannot be answered here. This is not legal advice.
